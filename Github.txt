Github

1. Download Git bash

2. Set username and email (No need to set again if already done earlier)
a) git  config --global user.name " "
   git  config --global user.email " "

3. git init (It will initialse the git repo which is hidden )
Work -> It tracks the directories (files/folder) except if folder is empty.
Note -> Don't write the command if you already initialise

4. rm -rf .git (It will delete the hidden .git repo & now we can't track files/folder in that directory)

5. ls (list content i.e all the files will be shown that are inside directory)

6. pwd (parent working directory)

7. For moving foward to any directory(dir) use cd directory/
   For moving backward to any directory(dir) use cd ..

8. touch filename ex - Error.log (It's useful to generate file in particular directory)

9. touch .gitignore(It will make .gitignore file)
  It's function to ignore git file that we put inside this file.

10. git remote add origin URL(Repo URL which you have made in remote/server)
    origin -> Name of URL(you can write something else also)
   In simple terms this command helps us to establish a connection b/w local and remote server

11. git remote -> It shows total no. of remote repo's 

12. git push -u origin master
    When you run "git push -u origin master", you're pushing your local "master" branch to the "master" branch in the remote repository named "origin."           Additionally, you're establishing a tracking relationship(-u called upstream) so that future Git commands like git push or git pull will use "origin" as the 
  default remote repository and "master" as the default branch for your local "master" branch.

13. git restore file name -> Changes in this file will all gets discard and its changes will match with older commit.
